## Hey there! I'm Leonardo :brazil:

### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp;Who am I? What's my story?

I've discovered programming when I was a kid, visiting online forums and doing some googling. At the begninning, never had any professional aspiration with code, just did it for fun every now and then: tic-tac-toe in C, Snake Game in Python, having fun with and Arduino, thinkering with HTML and CSS and so many other things.

Started to study chemical engineering at University and the more the time went on, the more I was in love with programming classes and not so much with reactors, tanks, heat exchangers and other chemical engineers stuff. **So what did I do?**

I've decided it was time to go after programming. And this time, to focus on a technology stack and stick to it. I'm now working as a software developer, using primarily **Javascript/Typescript**, **Node.js**, **React** and **React Native**.

If you want to know what I've been working on, check out my pinned repositories. I promise you will find friendly README's. :wink: :grin:
